# Alaska 2023

I live thirty minutes from my parents' - my mom's - place above the James, below the fall line where the river becomes tidal. 

To this day, I don't know how I knew to answer the phone. My phone was silent when I woke up - no vibrating, face down. I turned it over and my mom was calling. I picked up the phone knowing what was about to be said. On the other end, my mom: "Thomas, I have some bad news. Daddy's died in the night. I'm so sorry." 

Everything after that is a fog, at least up to the point at which I had my hands on the steering wheel, getting onto the toll road. I remember driving at an early hour in March - closer to midnight than not - down Powhite Parkway. I think I remember the trees - black against a dark, light-polluted, purple sky; the trees not quite ready to announce Spring. 

Arriving, I knew it was my responsibility to see my father's body - not that I had any idea what that would mean. My brother - bless him - being the oldest was the son who received the first call. He and I haven't spoken much about that morning; most of it we experienced together - but I will forever be grateful for his handling of one of the greatest of responsibilities ever asked of children. 

We arrived in Alaska in early April to weather that even locals were upset by; typically, at that time of the year, the roads have started mudding
up as the snow from the winter reaches its latter stages of melting out. This year, Talkeetna got pummeled. The quaint, fronteir's edge town - known
outside of the climbing for little more than "glacier landing tours" - was buried, shops were shut (couldn't get to them if you wanted to the banks
were so high), and the bars were crowded.
