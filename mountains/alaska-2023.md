# Alaska 2023

## I. Death

When they find ancient bodies, they sometimes find them with things: horses, wives, servants, gold, vehicles, pottery - the list is sometimes odd and very nearly endless. And I'd always thought, "How absolutely stupid." 

Then, when my father died, I understood everything.

My phone was silent when I lifted my head off my pillow - no vibrating, no light, face down. For no reason - maybe to check the time - I turned my phone over; my mom was calling. My dad, now in his late seventies, had had corrective heart surgery only a few days before. I answered the phone already knowing what was about to be said. On the other end of the phone, my mom: "Thomas, I have some bad news. Daddy's died in the night." 

Everything after that is a fog; at least up to the point at which I had my hands on my truck's steering wheel, getting onto the toll road, everything seems now to have been at best automatic. I remember driving at an early hour that day in March - closer to midnight than not - down Powhite Parkway. I remember still-winter trees - black against a light-polluted purple sky lining the road. My parents' - my mom's - place above the James, below the fall line where the river becomes tidal, is about thirty minutes Northeast by car.

"Do you want to see the body?"

"I don't know."

"Most people I have spoken to regret not seeing the body."

I paused. Breathed. And went to see my father.
 
Later that week, as I stood over my father, watching my dad's face as he lay in his coffin - chosen for its simplicity and resemblence to that of the monastics' - I held my son, then nearly seven months old. Standing there, I tried to remember my dad. No one else liked my dad's hair; but I liked the neatness. His hair reminded me of my father at my wedding, the picture I have of my wife hugging my happy father on that day. 

My family brought things for my father to have with him; I can't remember whether I had intentionally brought anything, but - in that moment - the thing I needed him to have was the thing I could no longer share, the thing I needed him to have forever. We found one of Simon's old swaddles, now used as a light blanket to keep him warm, and tucked it out of sight by his feet. 

A bit later and alone with him, I didn't know what to do or say; all I could do was think to tidy his hair - to move a small lock slightly out of place on his forehead and say, "Thanks, Dad."










## II. Back Alleys In Richmond

Sitting on the roof of my truck in a back alley of the Richmond Fan [District], smoking a cigarette and holding a beer, my friend had stopped everything and come to be with me after his work day had ended. It was dark - still march.

## II. The Year Before The Climb

It's 2023, now. May, to be precise. My father died 14 months ago. My first climb in over 18 months was 10 months ago - in early August 2022. 

On that climb, deep down (actually pretty close to the surface), I _hated_ that I was going climbing again - I remember driving at 7:30 AM to go pick up my climbing partner so we could go do something I didn't even really know if I wanted to do anymore: climbing. We were going to do some low-difficulty trad. climbing in the Flatirons, visible from Boulder, CO. 

On the drive over, drinking sugar free Red Bull and eating a "continental breakfast" (stale bread and questionable fruit stuffed in my small day pack), I tried to get the stoke going - but it wasn't there. 

"This is stupid. Why am I here?" I missed my family: my son, my wife. I missed my friends.

During a red light - on the nearly empty, pre-rush hour Boulder street - I managed to get a selfie for the internet. Maybe _that_ would make me feel better: feigning excitement for other people. 

As I pulled up to my partner's house, I started to forget that I didn't want to be there. As he stepped out of the house - cleanly shaven for the first time in the seven years that we've been climbing together - holding two cups (one open-topped glass with a smoothy and a thermos of coffee without a lid), I forgot everything.

We arrived in Alaska in early April to weather that even locals were upset by; typically, at that time of the year, the roads have started mudding
up as the snow from the winter reaches its latter stages of melting out. This year, Talkeetna got pummeled. The quaint, fronteir's edge town - known
outside of the climbing for little more than "glacier landing tours" - was buried, shops were shut (couldn't get to them if you wanted to the banks
were so high), and the bars were crowded.
