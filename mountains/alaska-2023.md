# Alaska 2023

## I. Death

I don't know how I knew to answer the phone. I was asleep. My phone was silent when I woke up - no vibrating, face down. I turned it over and my mom was calling. I picked up the phone knowing what was about to be said. On the other end, my mom: "Thomas, I have some bad news. Daddy's died in the night." 

Everything after that is a fog, at least up to the point at which I had my hands on the steering wheel, getting onto the toll road. I remember driving at an early hour in March - closer to midnight than not - down Powhite Parkway. I think I remember the trees - black against a dark, light-polluted, purple sky; the leafelss trees were not quite ready to announce Spring here in Central Virginia. My parents' - my mom's - place above the James, below the fall line where the river becomes tidal, is about thirty minutes Northeast by car.

My brother - bless him - being the oldest was the son who received the first call. He and I haven't spoken much about that morning; most of it we experienced together - but I will forever be grateful for what he handled alone. 

When I arrived, I knew it was my responsibility to see my father's body - not that I had any idea what that would mean. There is little I know about what my father would have wanted, but seeing his body - understanding his life - would have been his hope.

"Do you want to see the body?"

"I don't know."

"Most people I have spoken to regret not seeing the body."

I paused. Breathed. And went to see my father.

My dad used to joke he wanted to say goodbye to the world while holding a gin and tonic and watching the sunset from his balcony. What he really meant - I think at one level - was that he wanted he wanted a simple death. 

Later that week, as I stood over my father as he lay in his coffin - chosen for its simplicity and resemblence to that of the monastics' - I held my son, nearly seven months old. I couldn't have done that alone. 

I tried to remember his hugs. Everyone else didn't like my dad's hair - the caretaker had made it too neat; but I liked it - it reminded me of how my father's hair had looked at my wedding, of a picture I have of my wife hugging my father on that day. I didn't know what to do or say; all I could do was think to tidy his hair a bit - to move a small lock slightly out of place on his forehead and say, "Thanks, Dad."

## The Year Before

It's 2023, now. May, to be precise. My father died 14 months ago. My first climb in over 18 months was 10 months ago - in early August 2022. 

On that climb, deep down (actually pretty close to the surface), I _hated_ that I was going climbing again - I remember driving at 7:30 AM to go pick up my climbing partner so we could go do something I didn't even really know if I wanted to do anymore: climbing. We were going to do some low-difficulty trad. climbing in the Flatirons, visible from Boulder, CO. 

On the drive over, drinking sugar free Red Bull and eating a "continental breakfast" (stale bread and questionable fruit stuffed in my small day pack), I tried to get the stoke going - but it wasn't there. 

"This is stupid. Why am I here?" I missed my family: my son, my wife. I missed my friends.

During a red light - on the nearly empty, pre-rush hour Boulder street - I managed to get a selfie for the internet. Maybe _that_ would make me feel better: feigning excitement for other people. 

As I pulled up to my partner's house, I started to forget that I didn't want to be there. As he stepped out of the house - cleanly shaven for the first time in the seven years that we've been climbing together - holding two cups (one open-topped glass with a smoothy and a thermos of coffee without a lid), I forgot everything. 






## 

We arrived in Alaska in early April to weather that even locals were upset by; typically, at that time of the year, the roads have started mudding
up as the snow from the winter reaches its latter stages of melting out. This year, Talkeetna got pummeled. The quaint, fronteir's edge town - known
outside of the climbing for little more than "glacier landing tours" - was buried, shops were shut (couldn't get to them if you wanted to the banks
were so high), and the bars were crowded.
