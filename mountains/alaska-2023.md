# Alaska 2023

We arrived in Alaska in early April to weather that even locals were upset by; typically, at that time of the year, the roads have started mudding
up as the snow from the winter reaches its latter stages of melting out. This year, Talkeetna got pummeled. The quaint, fronteir's edge town - known
outside of the climbing for little more than "glacier landing tours" - was buried, shops were shut (couldn't get to them if you wanted to the banks
were so high), and the bars were crowded.
